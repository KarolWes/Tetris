# Tetris
I decided to write the Tetris, because it is one of the most popular games. It took me around 12 hours to complete. Everything is plain java, GUI designed using JavaFX. It suports basic functions of the game (moving left-right, falling, rotating). Shapes are coded as arrays of int pairs, describing the shift between pivot (point in which falling block is "locked") and actual colorful field.
